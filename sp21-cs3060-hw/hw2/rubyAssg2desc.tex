    \textbf{Due Date:}  Feb 4. 11:59 pm\\

    \textbf{Total points:} 50 points \\

    \textbf{Directions:} Using the source provided via Gitlab \@ \texttt{https://gitlab.com/sanroy/sp21-cs3060-hw/}, 
complete the assignment below. The process for completing this assignment should be as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item You already forked the Repository ``sanroy/sp21-cs3060-hw'' to a repository ``yourId/sp21-cs3060-hw'' under your username. If not, do it now.
        \item Get a copy of hw2 folder in ``sanroy/sp21-cs3060-hw'' repository as a hw2 folder in your repository ``yourId/sp21-cs3060-hw'' 
        \item Complete the assignment, committing changes to git. Each task code should be in a separate ruby file. As an example, task1.rb for Task 1. 
        \item Push all commits to your Gitlab repository
        \item If you have done yet done so, \textbf{add} TA and Roy (gitlab id \textbf{sanroy}) as a member (in `Developer' mode) of your Gitlab repository
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Tasks:}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item \textbf{(7 points) Task \#1:} Write a program that takes a string $x$ 
and a filename $f$ as input, and checks whether string $x$ appears in file $f$. Your 
program needs to print each line (in file $f$) that contains string $x$. 
Your program should also print the line numbers of the matching lines.
\emph{Writing readme carries 1 point.}

\textbf{Example run}: ruby $~~~$  task1.rb $~~~$ file-to-search-in $~~~$  string-to-search (e.g. "abc")

An example output is as follows.

\emph{Line 3: hdjdb bj\textbf{abc} bjb.}

\emph{Line 7: \textbf{abc}gjh 12bask 13hj djsbckb.} 


Note: 1. Your project repository needs to include a sample file-to-search-in. 2. Do NOT use any library's grep function. You implement it on your own, which may take only few lines of code.
      
  \item \textbf{(8 points) Task \#2:} Write a function that takes an array A of strings as the input 
and does the following: (a) Uses \emph{each} method to print the length of each element of A, 
(b) Uses \emph{select} method to find all the strings (in A) whose lengths are multiple of 3, 
(c) Uses \emph{map} method to build a new array with all-caps-version of the strings of A, 
and (d) Uses \emph{inject} method to find the sum of the length of all strings of A.
To test the function, build an array A of 10 random strings, 
and pass A into the function as a parameter.
\emph{Writing readme carries 1 point.}
        \item \textbf{(10 points) Task \#3:}. Function3A calculates the Fibonacci Series ($F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$) iteratively. 
Calculate all Fibonacci numbers ($F_n$) for $n=1$ to 35. 
Function3B calculates the same Fibonacci Series but using the recursion technique. 
After implementing the above two functions, compare the computation time (for doing the above calculation) 
using Ruby's benchmark library. \emph{Writing readme carries 1 point.}
\textbf{Hint}: if necessary, Ruby lecture slides (ppt) can help you write the iterative version.
        \item \textbf{(13 points) Task \#4:} The Tree class presented in the textbook (Day 2) chapter is interesting, but it does not allow 
you to specify a new tree with a clean user interface. (a) Update the constructor and all other methods to accomodate the creation of a tree using a Hash. 
The initializer should accept a nested structure of Hashes. You should be able to specify a tree as below. To test your functionality, you should traverse (by calling visit\_all method on the tree i.e. root node) this entire tree and print out the node names. (b) Write another method (like visit\_all) which counts the total number of nodes in the tree.

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Ruby]
            ruby_tree = Tree.new({
                'ggrandparent' => { 
                    'grandparent1' => 
                        {'parent1' => {'child1' => {}, 'child2' => {}},
                         'parent2' => {'child3' => {}} 
                        }, 
                    'grandparent2' => 
                        {'parent3' => {'child4' => {}}, 
                         'parent4' => {'child5' => {}, 'child6' => {}} 
                        }
                } 
            })
        \end{lstlisting}
\emph{Writing readme carries 1 point.}

\textbf{Hint:} for part (a) you may mainly modify the \emph{initialize} function of the Tree class.
       \item \textbf{(12 points) Task \#5:} In this task, your code creates a random list of 100 shape objects, 
then traverses the list from start to end, and computes the total area of the shape objects. 
First you need to implement the class hierarchy diagram of the shape types, which is attached. 
Shape is an abstract class which has only a "color" attribute whereas Circle class and Square
class are concrete children of Shape class, and they have more attributes and constructors. 
Note that you do not know beforehand the order of the shape objects 
(i.e. Circles and Squares) created in the random list, e.g., 
you do not know beforehand whether the 1st item is Circle or Square.
\emph{Writing readme carries 1 point.}

Note. When you traverse the list to calculate the total area, you call the area() function 
of each shape object (without considering whether it is Square or Circle). 
That means, you will use the concept of polymorphism.

\textbf{Hint:} While building the list of shape objects, use rand(2) to generate a random number 0 or 1; if 0, then you may add a Square object, else add a Circle object to the list.
